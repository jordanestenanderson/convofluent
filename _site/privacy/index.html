            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">4. How We Use Cookies</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">A cookie is a small computer file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Keep in mind, however, that some Services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">A “Functional Cookie” is a type of technology we may use with the purpose of allowing our Services to remember choices you make and provide you with a more personal experience, and to avoid you from having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Services.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">An “Analytics Cookie” is a type of technology we may use with the purpose of tracking traffic on our Services and also about how individuals use our Services. The information gathered may include the types of information described above in the section titled “What Information Do We Collect?” We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Services, and improve our Services. We use Google Analytics and Hotjar for this purpose. These parties use their own cookies.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light">A “Social Media Cookie” is a type of technology we may use with the purpose of tracking when you share information using a social media sharing button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website. The social network will record that you have done this. Social networks use their own cookies.</p>
            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">5. Disabling Cookies</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” menus). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Services.</p>
            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">6. Pixel Tags</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Services and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Services and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device, pixel tags are embedded invisibly within HTML. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of our Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively.</p>
            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">7. Software Development Kits</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">We may also use software development kits (“SDKs”) provided by third parties. SDKs enable us to provide features and functionality developed by third-party developers, including to provide us with analytics, and social media integrations.</p>

If you do share your password or your Personal Data with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Data and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Back n Forth and change your password.</p>
            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">10. Marketing Communications</h2>

            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">12. Do Not Track Signals</h2>

            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">13. Payments</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">Transactions on our Services involving your billing and payment information are processed by a third-party processor, Stripe, and are subject to its privacy policies.

            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">14. How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
            <p class="body-lg light">To protect your Personal Information, we take commercially reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. However, no data protection procedures are entirely infallible. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that it will be 100% secure. The transmission of your Personal Information to our Services thus is done entirely at your own risk.</p>
            <h2 class="title-2xl white legal-title">15. Third-Party Websites</h2>
