            <p class="body-lg light"><strong>Severability.</strong> All parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right. We both agree that if we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, then that part will be replaced with terms that most closely match the intent of the unenforceable part to the extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise provided in the Terms, the invalidity of part of this Terms will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The section headings are for convenience and do not have any force or effect.</p>

            <p class="body-lg light"><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither you nor Back n Forth shall be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war and terrorism, embargoes, boycotts, changes in governmental regulations, epidemics, fire, communication line failures, power failures, earthquakes, other disasters or any other reason where failure to perform is beyond the control of, and not caused by, the non-performing party.</p>
            <p class="body-lg light"><strong>Equitable Actions.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that any breach or threatened breach of these Terms may cause immediate and irreparable harm to Back n Forth which would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages and that Back n Forth may seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and/or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or anticipated breach without the necessity of posting a bond or other security.
